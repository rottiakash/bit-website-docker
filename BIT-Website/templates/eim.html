                    </div>
                    <p >The department of Instrumentation Technology was started in the year 1981-82 with the intake of 40 and later it was increased to 60. As indicated by the continuous opinion from the alumnae and up to date nEIMssities from the core industries, the department has been renamed as Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering. The department started new PG course in the academic year 2014-15 onwards with the sanctioned intake of 24. The main aim of this department is, to fulfill the requirement in frontier technology of Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering in the area of manufacturing, Instrumentation, Process control, Embedded System, Signal Processing and industrial automation.<br>

                      The department has been continuously imparting standard and quality service to the students for the past 36 years. The department produced 32 batches of undergraduates so far in which 15 batches under Bangalore University and 18 batches under Visvesvaraya Technological University. The department has been inculcating moral values in addition to the curricular and co-curricular activities. The Research and Development Centre was started in the academic year 2010-2011 to guide and assist the research scholars.<br>
                      
                      The department is proud about the performance of students in university examination to secure 25 Ranks under Bangalore University (1981-2001) and 43 Ranks under Visvesvaraya Technological University (VTU), (2002- till date). In last two years our students own Gold Medals by securing 1st Rank in University at State level.<br>
                      
                      The E&IE curriculum incorporates industry relevant technologies like Signal & Image Processing, Microcontrollers, VLSI, Computer communication Networks, Process Instrumentation, Control systems, Bio-Medical Instrumentation, Virtual Instrumentation, Robotics and controls etc., the contents of which are updated in compatibility with the changing industrial needs</p><br><br>
