                    <p >The Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering was started in the year 1992-93. The Department has a team of well qualified and dedicated staff members. On the forefront of development and with the advent of technological revolution and quantum development in the field of Electronics and Communications, due to myriad complexities of the e-world, it was inevitable for the evolution of another field to make a distinct identity of its own. Thus, the ball of development was set into motion and the Telecommunication field gradually assumed a role of pre-eminence which is shared by few other engineering disciplines in the modern world. <br><br>

                        The Department offers Under-Graduate [UG] Course and has a Research Center under V.T.U. It has excellent infrastructure facilities and all the labs are well equipped. The objective of the Department is to empower every student to be creative and productive in the field of Telecommunication Engineering by imparting excellent Technical Education and inculcating Human Values.<br><br>
                        
                        The Department offers an excellent academic environment with a team of highly qualified and dedicated faculties. Two staff members have obtained their Ph.D. degree and three other faculty members are pursuing their Ph.D. The Department has the credit of many Technical papers being published in National, International Journals and conference proceedings.<br><br>
                        
                        Most of our Electronics and Telecommunication engineering students get placed in good Companies like Robert Bosh, Oracle, Musigma, TCS, Wipro, IBM, Capgemini, Ericsson, Tech Mahindra, Indian Navy, HP, Infosys, I Gate, SOCIETE GENERAL, CISCO, Computer Science Corporation, Aricent, L&T Infotech, Allstate, Indegene life system, INTEL etc.<br><br>
                        
                        The Department has a Student Association called TESA to organize technical seminars and workshops for the benefit of students. They are also part of many clubs such as Rotaract club, Xkalibre, BIT ECO Club, Samskruthi , IEEE, Leo Club etc.<br><br>
                        
                        Dr.S.Shanthala is currently Professor and Head of Department, Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering Department, Bangalore Institute of Technology, Bangalore. She has 29 Years of teaching experience and is actively involved in the Research and Development work. Research papers are published in leading international journals and conference proceedings.   Prof. S. Shanthala has been awarded gold medal for one of her papers published in the Institute of Engineers Journal. She has authored a book on digital electronics which was published by spectrum publications. She has also been instrumental in obtaining financial aids from funding agencies for the on-going Research and Developmental work in the Department. One Research Scholar has been awarded the Ph.D. Degree under her guidance and there are 4 other Research scholars pursuing research. Her Research interests are VLSI and Embedded Systems.
