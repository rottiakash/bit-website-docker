<p>The department has VTU recognized R &amp; D center which engages the faculty and research scholars to help the institutions growth by motivating research, guiding students, conducting research and evaluating their status. The Department motivates staff towards research other than teaching. Faculties of ISE are engaged in paper publication and more than 60 publications have appeared in various national and international journals and conferences of IEEE, ACM, Springers, Elsevier etc. The research center of ISE has 2 guides namely Dr. J.Prakash and Dr.R.Nagaraja and the students are working as research scholars under various areas like Digital Image processing, pervasive middleware, Cloud computing and Routing in social networks etc. Faculties from our department and also from other institutions have registered for Ph.d in the research center. Two research scholars (Hema Jagadish and Hema malini) have been awarded Ph.D in the area of digital image processing. Students are also encouraged for paper publications.</p>
