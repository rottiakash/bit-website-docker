                    <p >In KARNATAKA STATE, BIT was the pioneer in establishing the COMPUTER SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING department, with affiliation to BANGALORE UNIVERSITY in the year 1981. The syllabus was framed by then H.O.D. Prof. M. Ramakrishna, ever since the department has adopted and evolved with the fast pace of technology. <br><br>

                        The Department offers Under-Graduation [UG], Post-Graduation [PG] and Research under VTU. PG programme, M. Tech in Computer Science and Engineering was established in the year 2008.<br><br>
                        
                        The Department has excellent infrastructure facilities with six labs, such as Algorithm & Data Structures, Database & Networking Labs, Web Technologies, System Software & Operating System Lab and The Microprocessor Lab, to prepare the techno savvy’s to conquer the demands of the IT industry, R&D organizations and computer related areas. The objective is to educate, train and develop world class research and IT professionals with a mastery of not only hardware and software skills but also soft skills for professional success that helps 95% of the Computer Science students to get placed in top software companies like JP Morgan, Akamai, Accenture, Robert Bosch, IGate etc. Most of the students are offered higher pay packages from software giants like Linkedin, Adobe, Netapp, Cisco, Oracle etc.<br><br>
                        
                        The Department offers an excellent academic environment with a team of highly qualified and dedicated faculties with most of the staff’s having doctoral degrees. Many other staff members are currently involved in doing their search work and are involved in taking care of several software projects. The department of Computer Science and Engineering constantly organizes seminars and other interactive programs to keep the student community updated about the latest happening in the IT-sector.<br><br>
                        
                        The Department is currently headed by Dr. Asha .T B.E., M.E., Ph.D</p><br><br>
